# SAS_Base_123_Crawler

It's a very simple python instance for me to crawl a website which contains SAS BASE EXAM Practise questions(known as SAS BASE 123 Questions).

The requirement is really simple. I just need to download the "core" contents from the website pages which have squentially links. While doing it manually would be incredibly painful so I decided to write a little crawler to solve this problem.

As you can see, it's just a stupid for loop with a little help from beautifulsoup and urllib libraries then output to a txt file.
While it's so simple, it really helps me out.
So, thank programming and Python. That's what everyone always said, Python Rocks~!
